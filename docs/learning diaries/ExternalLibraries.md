## Integrating SFML with Qt
Rendering SFML in a Qt Widget: One common approach is to render SFML inside a Qt widget. This can be done by creating a custom widget that inherits from a standard Qt widget (like QWidget or QFrame) and then integrating SFML's rendering capabilities into it. This way, you can use SFML for specific parts (like a canvas for rendering graphics) within a Qt-based GUI.

Event Handling: You'll need to manage event handling between Qt and SFML. Qt will handle the GUI events, while SFML handles events related to the multimedia part.

Thread Management: If you are using SFML in a separate thread from the Qt GUI thread, ensure proper synchronization and thread safety.

Combining Libraries: You must ensure that both libraries are properly linked in your build system (like CMake, QMake, etc.) and that they do not conflict, especially in terms of event loop management and window handling.
