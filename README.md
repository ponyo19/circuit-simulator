# Circuit Simulator

## Goals
This project aims to build a basic Circuit simulator. It is also a learning experience for me to learn the essentials of OOP, Cmake, relevant libraries, software design and testing.

## Core features
- Interactive graphical circuit design with basic electronics component.
- RMS voltage and current calculations.
- Simulation grpahs in time domain and frequency domain.
- Importing/Exporting circuit schemas in JSON format.

## Learning diary
- The learing diaries located in doc/learning_diaries/ will reflect my learning process. It includes the guidelines and tutorials that I will implement in this project.
